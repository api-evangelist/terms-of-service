title: 'Building Blocks'

<p>These are some of the common building blocks I have pullled from my research into this layer of the API space.</p>

<h2>Core Considerations</h2>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy of Information</strong> - What are the expectations for accuracy of information available via the platform. What is the bar, and how is this level determined and enforced. </li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> - What level of security is guaranteed as part of platform operations? How does the overall security practices impact the terms of service between platform and consumers?</li>
<li><strong>Opting Out</strong> - What are the possibilities for opting out of services? Are there data sharing, licensing, or communication areas that can be opted out, or NOT opted out of.</li>
<li><strong>Sites Covered</strong> - </li>
<li><strong>Childrens Privacy</strong> - Are there any special considerations for children's privacy. Will minors potentially be using the system, and what areas should be considered?</li>
<li><strong>Links to Non-Operators Web Sites</strong> - What are the levels of responsibility and liability when it comes to external links made available through platform operations.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Personal Information</strong> - What are the considerations for all other content and data areas. This not personally identifiable information, but everything else.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregate Information</strong> - What information is aggregated, and what are the considerations when it comes to the platform terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Log Files</strong> - Providing some details on how log files are used in platform operations, what is logged, and what isn't, and how things are collected, retained and shared.</li>
<li><strong>Cookies</strong> - </li>
<li><strong>Web Beacons</strong> - Are web beacons in use? Are they return as part of API operations, and possibly required in all web and mobile deployments</li>
<li><strong>Personal Information</strong> - What personal information is collected, stored, shared, and put to use? What are the security procedures, and other considerations for dealing with privacy of users personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Partner Resources</strong> - Are there any members-only and partner specific opportunities, and how do these different levels of access impact terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>How We Use Your Information</strong> - Be clear about how information is used. Is it only used as part of operations. Provide straightforward explanations of how information is put to work to power the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Information Sharing</strong> - How is information shared with partners, government, and any potentially external partners. Does this occur via the API, and how does this affect terms of service.</li>
<li><strong>Access To Information</strong> - What levels of access are there. Is everything available via APIs or downloads, or are there restrictions around what you can get access to.</li>
</ul>
