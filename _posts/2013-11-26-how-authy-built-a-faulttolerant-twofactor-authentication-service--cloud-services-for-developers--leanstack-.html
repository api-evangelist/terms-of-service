<p>Authy is solving an increasingly important problem: making security simple and reliable for consumers and developers.Consumers are recognizing the value of strong authentication and security for web apps they’re using.Developers traditionally have not bothered with the technology because of the added complexity.Authy was created to change that and make two-factor authentication available to everyone.They’re well on their way with companies like DuckDuckGo and Coinbase using their service.</p>
