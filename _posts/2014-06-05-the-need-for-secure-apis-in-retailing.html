<p>Applications in today’s retail industry are highly distributed and are generally connected by proprietary protocols.But trends toward expanding geographic distribution are driving increased demands for integration — and these demands are driving a greater use of application programming interfaces (APIs) in retail.Retailers worldwide are under tremendous pressure to innovate faster and cycle through inventory as quickly as possible.Also, aggressively managing inventory supply chains is increasingly challenging because consumers have online access to competitive retail Web sites and can easily purchase products elsewhere.“Showrooming” — the practice of examining merchandise in a traditional brick-and-mortar retail store but then shopping online to find a lower price for the same item — is placing increased margin pressure on retailers, particularly in countries like the US that have relatively low shipping costs.</p>
