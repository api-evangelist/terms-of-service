<p>Today were happy to announce that weve enabled two-factor authentication for all web access to Unfuddle accounts!Two-factor authentication adds a strong layer of security to accounts by requiring not just a username and password, but also an additional code which is tied to a device you have in your possession, typically a mobile device, such as a smartphone.This means that, once enabled, in order to sign in to you will need to provide both your username and password AND have your device with you in your possession.Next time you sign in to your account, you will be prompted to enable two-factor authentication for your user account.If you choose to continue with the setup, you will be guided through the necessary steps.</p>
