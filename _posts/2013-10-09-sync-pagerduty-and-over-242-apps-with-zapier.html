<p>We’re excited to announce that PagerDuty now integrates with Zapier.But this is far from our typical integration because with Zapier you are able to swap your data between PagerDuty and any other app that integrates with their service.Zapier offers a unique way to swap information between over 242 of your favorite web services.Recommended Zaps!It’s pretty chaotic here at PagerDuty, with a lot going on it’s important to keep ourselves organized.</p>
