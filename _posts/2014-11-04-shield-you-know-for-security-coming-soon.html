Since the early days of Elasticsearch, one could secure Elasticsearch using external systems.For example, since Elasticsearch APIs are exposed through REST over HTTP, users secure it using proxies or firewalls.With the explosive adoption of Elasticsearch and the ELK stack, our customers and users started to ask us for a more integrated security solution with advanced features that are not implemented using external systems.After spending a lot of time with our customers, some of them with very demanding security requirements, we started to work on a security product within Elasticsearch, which we named Shield.(Any Marvel fans out there sensing a theme?</p>
