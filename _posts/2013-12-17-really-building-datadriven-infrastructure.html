<p>This year, I was pleased to have a talk about data-driven infrastructure accepted for PuppetConf.I talked a bit about the conceptual overview for how to build a computing infrastructure that responds to data.This includes data inputs from a human (or Octocat), and inputs from events that occur.It’s quite incredible to see infrastructures seemingly take over in daily operations.When I talk about the things that are possible, people get really excited about the possibility of being unburdened from ‘Yet Another Ops Task’, and they are eager to get started.</p>
