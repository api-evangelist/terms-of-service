<p>As more and more governments release data around the world, the conditions under which it is published and may be used will become increasingly important.Just as open formats make data easier to put to work, open licenses make it possible for all members of the public to use it without fear.Given that wonky but important issue, it’s important that governments that want to maximize the rewards of the work involved in cleaning and publishing open government data get the policy around its release right.Today, several open government advocates have released an updated Best-Practices Language for Making Data “License-Free”, which can found online at at theunitedstates.io/licensing.</p>
