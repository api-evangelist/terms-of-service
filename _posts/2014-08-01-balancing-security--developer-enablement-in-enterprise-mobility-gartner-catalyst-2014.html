<p>It’s that time of year again… time for another beautiful late-summer Gartner Catalyst conference in America’s Finest City: San Diego.Aside from being my hometown, the reason San Diego is so great is that it has balance.The warm sun is balanced by the cool ocean breeze, the strong business climate is balanced by the laid-back surf culture and the delicious fish tacos are balanced by a cold Corona.Balance makes everything better.Maintaining this balance is just as important when you’re talking about mobile strategy for your enterprise; that’s why I’ll be presenting a talk titled Balancing Security & Developer Enablement in Enterprise Mobility at Catalyst.</p>
