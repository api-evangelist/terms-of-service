<p>With last week’s announcement that Google will start rewarding those sites with HTTPS security configurations with better search result rankings, many companies will now be faced with a difficult decision.HTTPS is used as an added layer of security to standard HTTP sites, and has become necessary for companies that deal in eCommerce, financial tracking, or any other sort of site on which users have to log in or are expected to enter sensitive information.Therefore, Google’s rationale for taking this measure is to ensure that the pages that it directs its users to are operating as securely as possible (even if HTTPS is hardly a cure-all for security issues online).It would stand to reason, therefore, that sites who are still operating under HTTP should switch to the more secure connection.However, it’s not that simple.</p>
