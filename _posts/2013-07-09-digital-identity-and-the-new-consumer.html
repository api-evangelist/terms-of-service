<p>At Janrain, we’re pretty excited about the evolution of Digital Identity.What started as a concept for connecting an online representation of a real world person turned into something far beyond what science fiction conceived as “Cyberspace” 30 years ago.Digital identity is you visualized by your behavior on social networks.Digital identity is you, quantified by your financial transactions and purchase history.Digital identity is a bracelet that tracks your sleep and calorie burn.</p>
