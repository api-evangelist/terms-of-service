<p>If you’re looking for another reason to hate Gogo, the much-criticized ISP of the skies, then it just provided one.Neowin revealed on Monday that the Gogo is messing with the SSL (secure socket layer) certificates issued by websites to encrypt traffic coming to and from your browser.According to Neowin, Google security engineer Adrienne Porter Felt discovered the tactic when surfing Google sites.Gogo was replacing the SSL certificates she would normally get from Google with the ISP’s own certificates.This is the kind of ploy you’d usually see when a malicious hacker is performing a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
