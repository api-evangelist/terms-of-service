<p>On December 22, 2014
Snapchat has disappeared from Windows Phone.The ephemeral messaging service doesn’t offer an official app on the moribund platform, and Snapchat has reportedly asked Microsoft to remove third-party applications from the Windows Phone Store.That’s sure to frustrate consumers who relied on those applications to access Snapchat, but it’s also a victory of sorts, because using those unofficial apps undermines the peace of mind afforded by the supposedly-temporary nature of items sent via the service.Snapchat warned about that possibility after thousands of images shared on its network were leaked in October.It then said in November that because some developers “build services that trick Snapchatters and compromise their accounts” it would ask users to stop using unauthorized apps.</p>
