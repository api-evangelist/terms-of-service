<p>A cyber attack targeting TV channel MSNBC highlights cybercriminals’ abuse of the public’s trust in news outlets and websites, says Websense Security Labs.The security firm said its researchers have observed a first of its kind spam-based attack campaign that redirected users from the MSNBC website to a malicious fake news site.The attack abused the company’s publicly available Bitly application program interface (API) key to create custom URL shorteners for redirecting victims, the researchers said.So far, Websense Security Labs has identified that the spam messages containing the malicious links are being spread through Google and Yahoo groups, and email.Bitly is a service to shorten URLs into a more user-friendly format.</p>
