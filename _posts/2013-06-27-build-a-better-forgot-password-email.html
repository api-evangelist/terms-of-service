<p>You might be wondering how to customize the forgot password email and embed a password recovery link.Typically, you will call a forgotPassword endpoint through our SDKs or via REST and generate a generic email that displays a temporary password for your user.The user enters the temp password along with a username and new password into a form and submits it to StackMob’s API to reset their password.Copy and pasting works, but linking to a password reset form and populating fields would be better user experience.Let’s see how to do this on StackMob!</p>
