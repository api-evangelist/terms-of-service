<p>By now you’ve probably heard of Bourne-Again Shell (bash) Shellshock vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169).Since the issue was announced on Wednesday morning, at Puppet Labs we have been evaluating our customers’ risk and exposure while trying to wade through new information as it came to light.We have confirmed that if you’re able to patch your Puppet Enterprise masters and consoles with the latest bash packages available from your Linux distribution vendor, you should be safe.There are patches available from
Thus far, we haven’t been able to find any vulnerabilities agent side, even with an old bash installation, but we strongly recommend updating bash everywhere as soon as possible.It is very unlikely there is a significant downside to accepting new bash packages from your vendors, and our advice is to accelerate your patch acceptance process for bash.</p>
