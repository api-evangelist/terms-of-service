<p>While the specifications for both XML (via XLink) and HTML (via anchor tags, the “a” element) have hypertext references built into their respective specifications, there is no such JSON-specific specification for linking.This means there are many different ways to add hypertext to your REST + JSON API.Some examples include Collection+JSON, HAL and Siren.But Stormpath has our own approach, which is particularly simple and elegant while enabling a very powerful feature common to REST APIs.We will cover it in this post in case you want to use it in your own API.</p>
