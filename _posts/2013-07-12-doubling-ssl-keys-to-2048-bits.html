<p>As we stated in previous articles, security and privacy are very important to us.In addition to the product security enhancements we made to the service, we recently updated the SSL certificate for www.evernote.com to use a 2048-bit key.Many other companies are going through the same process because by the end of 2013, certificates with 1024-bit keys issued by major certificate authorities will expire.</p>
