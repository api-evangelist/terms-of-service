<p>27 Jan 2015   
As we get close to wrapping up the first month in 2015, it is clear that Internet security and privacy will continue to be front and center this year.As technology continues to play a central role in our personal and business lives--security, transparency, and respect for privacy is only growing more critical.I know Im biased in thinking that APIs will continue to take a central role in this conversation, but I feel it is true.Many of the existing conversations around security about platforms like Snapchat, and MoonPig, are directly related to APIs, while other security scope at companies like Sony, JP Morgan Chase, and beyond could easily be reduced with a sensible API strategy.Companies are increasingly operating online, but do not act like any of information lives in an online environment.</p>
