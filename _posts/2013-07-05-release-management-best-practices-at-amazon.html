<p>When you think about scale, you probably think about Amazon.And Werner Vogels, Amazon’s CTO, has plenty to say about practicing release management at scale.In a review of Vogels’ speech at Amazon’s developer conference, Charles Babcock of Information Week highlights the influential CTO’s view that enterprise IT development has to be recrafted in favor of systems that are controllable, resilient, adaptive and data driven.Vogels thinks of controllable applications as “decomposed into small, loosely coupled, stateless building blocks.” These run in an environment where the systems architect no longer thinks about physical servers, and so is no longer bound by resource constraints.</p>
