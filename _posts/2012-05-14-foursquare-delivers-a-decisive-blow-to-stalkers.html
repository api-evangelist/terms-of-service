<p>This week foursquare announced API changes to eliminate privacy concerns and creepy stalker apps like Girls Around Me.So, what are they changing?Foursquare is removing the ability for users to see people (even those not on their friends list) who are checked in to a venue without being checked in to the same venue themselves.Akshay Patil (foursquare API evangelist) explains it further: “much like how the users could see each other by looking around in real life.” Users will still be able to see friend check-ins regardless of whether they’re checked in to the same venue or not.</p>
