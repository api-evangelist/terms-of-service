<p>As part of our push to treat our API as a first class part of the Product, we’ve enabled CORS headers so you can embed information about your PagerDuty account in an intranet page with only client side scripting.This means, for instance, that you can embed the status of a service inside a wiki page with only JavaScript.I’ll try to roll out some more sample code soon, but the following snippet works in all modern browsers (assuming the page already has jQuery):
 jQuery.ajax({          url: https://[subdomain].pagerduty.</p>
