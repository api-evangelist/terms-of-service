<p>CloudFlare has made good on a promise it made back in August, by turning on SSL encryption for the webpages of all its customers.The firm, which provides content delivery and anti-DDoS services, announced the rollout of “Universal SSL” in a Monday blog post.It said it would provide protected “https” connections for users of around two million websites – apparently doubling the number of SSL-protected websites out there.However, beneficiaries still have work to do if they want to fully protect their customers, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince said in the post:
For a site that did not have SSL before, we will default to our Flexible SSL mode, which means traffic from browsers to CloudFlare will be encrypted, but traffic from CloudFlare to a site’s origin server will not.We strongly recommend site owners install a certificate on their web servers so we can encrypt traffic to the origin.</p>
