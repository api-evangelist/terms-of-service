<p>We have made security updates to our API which have produced an unforeseen ill effect when being accessed via HTTP Post.  The current workaround for customers would be to add an “s” to the “http” in the url pointing to our APIs.  Any request coming in as SOAP should not experience any problems.We deeply regret any complications this may have caused.</p>
