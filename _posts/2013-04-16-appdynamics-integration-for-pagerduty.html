<p>It’s a busy integration-filled day at PagerDuty.We’re excited to announce an integration with AppDynamics, a popular enterprise application performance monitoring and management solution. By combining AppDynamics’ granular visibility of applications with PagerDuty’s reliable alerting capabilities, customers can make sure the right people are proactively notified when business impact occurs, so IT teams can get their apps back up and running as quickly as possible.You’ll need PagerDuty and AppDynamics accounts to get started – if you don’t already have both, you can sign up for free trials of PagerDuty and AppDynamics.  Once you complete this simple integration, you’ll start receiving incidents in PagerDuty created by AppDynamics out-of-the-box policies.</p>
