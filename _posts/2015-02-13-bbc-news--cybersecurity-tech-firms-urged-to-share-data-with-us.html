<p>Cybersecurity: Tech firms urged to share data with US
Private tech firms should share more information with government and with each other to tackle cybercrime, according to US President Barack Obama.We have to work together like never before Mr Obama said during a speech at a White House cybersecurity summit hosted in Silicon Valley.The issue has become a White House priority since a widely publicised hack of Sony Pictures at the end of 2014.But some key tech firms are concerned about government surveillance.Senior Google, Yahoo and Facebook executives turned down invitations to the summit, held at Stanford University.</p>
