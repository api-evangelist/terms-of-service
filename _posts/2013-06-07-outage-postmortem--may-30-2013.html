<p>As a member of PagerDuty’s realtime engineering team, a top concern is designing and implementing our systems with high availability and reliability. On May 30, 2013 we had a brief outage that resulted in a degradation of our alerting reliability. This post summarizes what happened and what we are doing moving forward to ensure it doesn’t happen again.Impact
 On May 30, 2013 at 22:50 UTC, our on-call engineers were paged due to an issue in the Linode Fremont datacenter.This particular datacenter was experiencing network latency issues, as verified by Linode on their status page about 6 minutes later.</p>
