<p>It is hard to believe January is already over.We will remember this month as one filled with a lot of hard work, implementing cool features and fixing some interesting bugs.All of this came to fruition today since we pushed a new release out of the door.To sum the release up with just one word, it would be called “awesome”.Here’s a brief summary of what you will find now in Backendless:
 Object Access Control List (ACL)
 Any time you save an object in Backendless using the Data Service, we automatically assign the ‘owner’ to the object (assuming there is a currently logged in user).</p>
