<p>On June 3rd and 4th, PagerDuty’s Notification Pipeline suffered two large SEV-1 outages.On the 3rd, the outage resulted in a period of poor performance that led to some delayed notifications.On the 4th, the outage was more severe.In order to recover from the outage, inflight data from the system was purged and resulted in failed notification delivery, failure to accept incoming events from our integration API, and a significant number of delayed notifications.We would like to apologize to all of our customers who were affected by this outage.</p>
