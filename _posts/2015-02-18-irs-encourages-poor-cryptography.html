<p>Im not sure what to make of this, or even what it means.The IRS has a standard called IDES: International Data Exchange Service: The International Data Exchange Service (IDES) is an electronic delivery point where Financial Institutions (FI) and Host Country Tax Authorities (HCTA) can transmit and exchange FATCA data with the United States.Its like IRS data submission, but for other governments and foreign banks.It was because a person friendly to the Bush administration was aranging for all the Swift transaction data to be made available to the US Gov to aid in the war on terror.when the Europeans were made aware of this via the work of PI, the kick back was very large , and the fall out was significant.</p>
