<p>Ben Brauer, Senior  Product Manager on the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) team,  sent along a guest post describing a new, industry standard way to do identity  federation with AWS.-- Jeff;
  
  Over the years, we’ve had a number of blog posts that described how AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables identity federation.(For those whod like some background, see previous posts on identity federation with IAM, single sign-on (SSO) to the AWS Management Console, and web identity federation).These prior solutions worked for many customers, but some of you wanted SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) support so that you could leverage your existing investment in SAML-based identity management software.Today, we’re excited to announce we’ve expanded our identity federation to include support for SAML 2.</p>
