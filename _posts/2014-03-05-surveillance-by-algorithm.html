<p>Increasingly, we are watched not by people but by algorithms.Amazon and Netflix track the books we buy and the movies we stream, and suggest other books and movies based on our habits.Google and Facebook watch what we do and what we say, and show us advertisements based on our behavior.Google even modifies our web search results based on our previous behavior.Smartphone navigation apps watch us as we drive, and update suggested route information based on traffic congestion.</p>
