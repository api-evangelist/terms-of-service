<p>OWASP recently updated its list of top 10 security vulnerabilities and, judging by the accompanying assessment, security continues to be a major issue with todayâ€™s applications.This is especially true now in the era of APIs, where companies are making their core assets and business processes available for others to integrate in the hope of becoming a crucial (and thus monetizable) part of an ecosystem.In this era, the risk for intrusion attacks, data theft or just plain-old DOS attacks is evident.The risk might be small, but the consequences enormous.Consider the Playstation Network outage that exposed 77 million user accounts, or the more recent Twitter security breach that exposed more than 250,000 accounts.</p>
