<p>It’s no secret that Facebook is worth about $100 billion because it  collected personal data about its users.A lot of data.Although Twitter tracks its users too — albeit in a much less aggressive way — the company has decided to take a different route.It announced Thursday that it is joining Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox Web browser, and giving its users the ability to opt-out of being tracked in any way through Twitter.Twitter is doing this by enabling the Do Not Track feature in the Firefox browser that enables people to opt-out of cookies that collect personal information and any third-party cookies, including those used for advertising.</p>
