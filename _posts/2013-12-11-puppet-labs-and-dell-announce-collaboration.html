<p>Last week we mentioned that Dell will be using open source Puppet with its Active System Manager (ASM).We couldnt have been happier: One of the best parts of working on open source software is learning when it helps others.Were pleased to announce that Dells use of open source Puppet with ASM is official today.Coming in 2014, ASM 7.5 will allow you to manage compute, networking and storage resources with open source Puppet.</p>
