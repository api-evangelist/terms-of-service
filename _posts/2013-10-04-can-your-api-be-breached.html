<p>TLS and SSL form the foundations of security on the Web.Everything from card payments to OAuth bearer tokens depend on the confidentiality and integrity that a secure TLS connection can provide.So when a team of clever engineers unveiled a new attack on SSL/TLS – called BREACH – at July’s Black Hat conference, more than a few eyebrows were raised.Now that it’s Cyber Security Awareness Month, it seems like a good time to examine the BREACH threat.There have already been a number of articles in the technology press identifying threats BREACH poses to traditional Web sites and suggesting ways to mitigate the risks but it is important for us to examine this attack vector from an API perspective.</p>
