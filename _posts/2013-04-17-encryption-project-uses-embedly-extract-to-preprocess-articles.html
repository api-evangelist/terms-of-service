<p>Embedly was selected to present our APIs and offer support as an ambassador at the 2013 hackNY. There was lots of energy in the room, with a focus on projects being awesome, rather than chasing hockey stick growth. They even had a hardware hacking room with 3D printers. 
 
  One of the projects, Edison Encryption, used the Embedly Extract API as one of the steps for an encryption algorithm. The team consisted of Eric Schles, Dan Cohen, Chris Williams, and Danny Padawer.</p>
