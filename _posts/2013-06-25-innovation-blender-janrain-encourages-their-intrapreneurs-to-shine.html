<p>Anthony: With the Innovation Blender, we wanted to give Janrain employees the opportunity to break away from their typical work day, let their inner entrepreneur walk into the spotlights, give them a reason to connect with one another and provide a glimpse into what co-workers do on a daily basis.Although initiated by our Engineering team, we wanted the event to be cross-discipline and open to the whole company, which we achieved and witnessed strong collaboration by peers who don’t typically have the opportunity to work together.With over 25 pitches, 7 projects worked on and over one hundred participants representing most areas of the company, the first Innovation Blender is a resounding success.We kicked things off with the ‘pitching’ session.Going down the list, employees presented their ideas in front the jam packed set of bleachers of the basketball court.</p>
