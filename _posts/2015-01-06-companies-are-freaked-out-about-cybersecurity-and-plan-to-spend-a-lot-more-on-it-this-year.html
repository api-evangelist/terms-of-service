<p>Reports of security breaches reached new heights in 2014, following the iCloud and Sony hacks.Many consider the Sony hack to be the worst cyberattack in US corporate history.And it looks as if these attacks are having a direct impact on the amount companies are spending on computer security.According to a survey by Piper Jaffray, security was ranked as the top spending priority for CIOs this year, with a whopping 75% of the respondents saying they would increase spending in 2015.Security was the top concern last year, too, but only 59% had indicated they would increase spending in it.</p>
