I was taking another look at the Reddit API over the weekend, and thought their listing of API endpoints was pretty interesting.They provide two ways of looking at the platform APIs:
API Section - Listing of Reddit APIs by account, apps, links, listings, and other groupings.oAuth Scope - Listing of Reddit APIs by the endpoints oAuth scope.Not sure if it is something all APIs should follow, I just thought it was an interesting approach, something I haven’t seen in any other API area.Reddit has a number of APIs, I can see if you have specific goals with the API, this might be useful to have API sorted in this way.</p>
