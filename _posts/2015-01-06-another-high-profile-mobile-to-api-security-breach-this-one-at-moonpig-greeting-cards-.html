<p>06 Jan 2015   
I saw a story of yet another security breach related to how mobile phones are using APIs today. This one is from Paul Price, on his blog  ifc0nfig.com, about the greeting card site MoonPig.Paul highlights the not just lack of, but actual absence of security when making API calls to MoonPig, allowing you to impersonate any user, place orders, add/retrieve card information, and any other API driven feature of the mobile application.MoonPig is looking into it of course:
We are aware of claims re customer data and can confirm that all password and payment information is and has always been safe.</p>
