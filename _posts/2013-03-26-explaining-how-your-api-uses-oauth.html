<p>This guest post comes from Peter Gruenbaum , founder of SDK Bridge , a company that writes API documentation so that your developers don’t have to.He has worked as an API writer to describe APIs for eCommerce, traffic prediction, electric utilities, mobile phones, and tractors, just to name a few.OAuth is becoming a very popular way to control authorized access to Web APIs and the data that they return.Although it’s one of the most straightforward ways to accomplish this, it’s still rather confusing to use.If your API uses OAuth, then you need to be able to describe it so that developers can quickly understand what they need to do.</p>
