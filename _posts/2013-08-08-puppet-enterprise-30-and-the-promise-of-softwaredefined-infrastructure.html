<p>In the past few weeks weve written about the effort Puppet Labs engineers put into improving the performance and scalability of Puppet Enterprise 3.0, as well as refining its orchestration engine to enhance its cloud automation capabilities.Those improvements make it easier to manage infrastructure, but what about describing the infrastructure itself?Something we havent written about yet is how Puppet Enterprise 3.0 can get you further down the path of creating software-defined infrastructure.</p>
