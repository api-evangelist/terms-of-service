<p>By  Editor Posted on  June 15,12 																The volume of open APIs – application programming interfaces – is rising and with it, the number of gateways is also soaring, creating a number of security issues along the way, says Peter Logan, an application engineer with Intel.Speaking at the Cloud World Forum event in London this week, Logan explained that in 2007 the number of open APIs numbered around the 500 mark and by the end of last year it had numbered more than 4,000 – a figure he expects to have risen significantly as we reach the mid-point of 2012.“The problem with this rise is the similar rise in the number of gateways that this situation creates – where SOAP and other technologies come to the fore,” he explained.ITSP notes that SOAP – the Simple Object Access Protocol – is a protocol specification for exchanging structured information in the implementation of Web Services in computer networks.The protocol relies on XML – extensible mark-up language – for its message format, and also usually relies on other Application Layer protocols, most notably HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol and SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol) for message negotiation and transmission.</p>
