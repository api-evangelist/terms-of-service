<p>Guest blog post from Simon Westlake is the Chief Technical Officer for Powercode, a complete CRM, OSS and billing system designed for ISPs.Powercode is in use by over two hundred ISPs around the globe.Since Powercode is used worldwide by a variety of different types of ISPs, we have integrations with all kinds of different third party services.These integrations encompass email account management, invoice printing, credit card processing, vehicle tracking, equipment provisioning and much more.However, most of these integrations only end up benefiting a handful of our customers, which is why it was a very pleasant surprise to see the heavy utilization of PagerDuty amongst our customers when we integrated it.</p>
