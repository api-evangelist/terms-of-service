<p>The Wikimedia Foundation believes strongly in protecting the privacy of its readers and editors.Recent leaks of the NSA’s XKeyscore program have prompted our community members to push for the use of HTTPS by default for the Wikimedia projects.Thankfully, this is already a project that was being considered for this year’s official roadmap and it has been on our unofficial roadmap since native HTTPS was enabled.Our current architecture cannot handle HTTPS by default, but we’ve been incrementally making changes to make it possible.Since we appear to be specifically targeted by XKeyscore, we’ll be speeding up these efforts.</p>
