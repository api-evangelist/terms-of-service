<p>No one has admitted taking down North Koreas Internet.It could have been an act of retaliation by the US government, but it could just as well have been an ordinary DDoS attack.The follow-on attack against Sony PlayStation definitely seems to be the work of hackers unaffiliated with a government.Not knowing who did what isnt new.Its called the attribution problem, and it plagues Internet security.</p>
