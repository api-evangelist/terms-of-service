<p>This document gives a good overview of how NIST develops cryptographic standards and guidelines.Its still in draft, and comments are appreciated.Given that NIST has been tainted by the NSAs actions to subvert cryptographic standards and protocols, more transparency in this process is appreciated.I think NIST is doing a fine job and that its not shilling for the NSA, but it needs to do more to convince the world of that.</p>
