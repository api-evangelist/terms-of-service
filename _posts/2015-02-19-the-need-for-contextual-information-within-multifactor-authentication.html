<p>It’s no secret that context is an important component of good security.Does your bank call you every time you charge a purchase to your credit card?Of course not.That would be highly inconvenient and, as we know, people are far less likely to embrace new practices (technological or otherwise) if the practices interrupt their lifestyle.Rather, banks use contextual information — Is this an irregular purchase from an irregular location?</p>
