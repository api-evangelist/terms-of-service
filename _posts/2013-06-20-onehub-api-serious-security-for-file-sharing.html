<p>For large companies who require the constant transfer of files and private information, the need for a system that can store, organise and share files quickly and efficiently is paramount; and even more so, the need for that system to be safe and secure.Onehub is a file sharing application that puts security and a high level of control over file sharing at the forefront, making it an attractive solution for companies who need to share sensitive business information.Onehub also provides the Onehub API that enables developers to access this data on behalf of a client.Making use of the very 256-bit encryption and physical security policies that banks use, Onehub’s top priority is to protect a client’s data.Other features that enhance this security are things like the role based permissions, which allows administrators to easily control the level of access to their files, controlling who can just view the file and who can actually download or copy the file.</p>
