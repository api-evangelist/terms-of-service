<p>The proliferation of mobile devices has created a firestorm of demand for Application Programming Interfaces (API) to act as data gateways between devices and services. But fire can also be a destructive force, and mis-managed APIs can hurt application performance, alienate developers and even lead to costly and damaging data breaches.API Security Is Critical
  Among other things, APIs serve as gateways to Web-based services like Twitter or Facebook.They are the specifications that let developers build applications that communicate directly with those services.You can think of APIs as doors; they let data in and out of a Web service.</p>
