<p>Although we participate in the development of modules and release them to the Puppet Forge, the OpenStack modules would not have been possible without the community of individuals and partner companies that has grown up around the OpenStack StackForge project.We thank everyone who contributed features and patches to this release.These new modules bring us up to date with Grizzly, the latest stable release of OpenStack.They pair up with the OpenStack projects, allowing for individual installation and management of compute (Nova), storage (Swift, Glance, and Cinder) and management (Horizon).Weâ€™ve also released a generic OpenStack module that supports both all-in-one and multi-node installations.</p>
