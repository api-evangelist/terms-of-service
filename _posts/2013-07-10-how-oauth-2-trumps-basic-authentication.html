<p>So many negatives have been brought forth in the past on OAuth 2.Where there might be continuing points of contention, there is one area which seems to be clear: the “Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant” (OAuth 2 Spec, section 4.3) pattern as defined in the OAuth 2 spec is fundamentally superior to HTTP Basic authentication.This formula describes gaining access to server resources directly.This approach might be utilized when you are securing your own resources; for instance, your mobile app that is accessing your own API.</p>
