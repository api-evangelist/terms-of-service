<p>Posted 						on December 11, 2013 						by  ilya sabanin 						 						 							 						 					The Beanstalk API is a set of REST resources that you can use to build tools and applications that extend functionality of Beanstalk itself.Every user can access the API (as long as the account owner enabled it in the settings) to obtain information about repositories, commits, deployments and so forth.For years we’ve been using regular username & passwords (same ones that you use to log into the web app) to authenticate for the API.It was working fine for the most part but didn’t provide flexibility necessary for some use cases.You couldn’t have separate API credentials for different applications, for example; or change the API credentials without changing your primary web app ones.</p>
