<p>Now there’s an API available for every element of the PagerDuty system! PagerDuty escalation policies can now be queried through a new API that lets you access, add, modify and delete escalation policies and rules.In addition, the PagerDuty team has rebuilt the escalation policy web interface from scratch. The layout has been optimized to make it simpler to use and easier to understand how an incident will get escalated through your team.You can find detailed instructions on using the new escalation policy API at our developer site.</p>
