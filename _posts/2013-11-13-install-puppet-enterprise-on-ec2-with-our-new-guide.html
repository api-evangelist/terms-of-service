<p>One of the advantages of cloud environments is the ability to quickly stand up and tear down an instance as needed: Thats great for deploying web-scale apps, adding and removing resources as needed.Its also a great way to evaluate a new application without having to run it on one of your own servers: Just spin up a cloud node, evaluate at your leisure, then tear it down.Download the guide as a PDF   
 
  Weve published a new downloadable guide that shows you how to do just that with Puppet Enterprise on an Amazon EC2 instance.Following the guide, youll be able to get a Puppet Enterprise master and agent up and running on EC2, then use your new master to configure and manage up to 10 nodes — on-premise or also in the cloud with your new master — for free.If youre the type who likes to see a demo before trying something out, weve also produced three new videos that step you through the process of using AWS to install a puppet master and agent, then deploy a web application to your new agent node.</p>
