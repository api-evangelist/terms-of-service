<p>Beginning today, all GitHub Pages sites are moving to a new, dedicated domain: github.io.This is a security measure aimed at removing potential vectors for cross domain attacks targeting the main github.com session as well as vectors for phishing attacks relying on the presence of the github.com domain to build a false sense of trust in malicious websites.</p>
