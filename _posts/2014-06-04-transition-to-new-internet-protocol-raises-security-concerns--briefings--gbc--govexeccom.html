<p>June 4, 2014 - Two years ago, on June 6, 2012, thousands of websites and Internet service providers launched a new version of the Internet Protocol, the mechanism that directs and routes communications through the Internet.Though Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) currently accounts for only three percent of all Internet communications, this figure is expected to grow to more than 20 percent by 2016.Federal agencies, however, are required to move even faster.OMB guidance from July 2012 mandated that agencies adopt IPv6 for external sites and services by the end of FY2012 and for internal applications by the end of FY2014.But the latest NIST statistics show agencies are struggling to meet these milestones.</p>
