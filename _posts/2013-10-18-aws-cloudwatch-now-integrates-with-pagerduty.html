<p>We’re excited to announce that AWS CloudWatch now integrates with PagerDuty.In a recent survey we conducted, we learned that nearly 13% of people who use PagerDuty have AWS CloudWatch deployed in their IT environments, making an integration with CloudWatch a no brainer.Although PagerDuty can already be used with all your existing monitoring tools by rerouting and creating incidents from email notifications, integrations allow us to push beyond certain limitations and more easily exchange data between systems.AWS CloudWatch provides resources and monitoring solutions that track metrics to help you gain insights and keep your apps and business running smoothly.By combining PagerDuty with AWS CloudWatch’s system-wide visibility, you are given the ultimate flexibility in how you receive alerts and create incidents to reduce your teams mean time to repair (MTTR).</p>
