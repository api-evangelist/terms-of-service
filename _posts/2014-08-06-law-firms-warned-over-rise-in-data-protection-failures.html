<p>6th August 2014
This week, the legal profession became the latest segment of the UK economy to come under the scrutiny of the regulator responsible for enforcing the Data Protection Act.In a statement issued yesterday (August 5th), the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) sent out an official warning to the countrys law firms over an alarming spate of breaches in which their clients personal information was compromised.The ICO claims that in the past three months alone, it has received 15 reports of incidents in which members of the legal profession allowed confidential records to fall into the wrong hands, or to be exposed to the public when they should have been kept private.Theres an obvious reason that solicitors and barristers are so frequently implicated in these types of data breaches: they typically carry around huge volumes of paperwork in files and folders, taking them to and from court and often storing them at home.As a result, the likelihood of a clients personal information ending up lost or stolen - left unattended in a car or in public, for example - is high.</p>
