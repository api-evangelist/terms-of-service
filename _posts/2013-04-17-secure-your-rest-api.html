<p>* Do not use passwords as API authentication.The user of an API is a computer program, not a human.Issue single-purpose random credentials for API access.]
* Make sure that your API is accessible only over HTTPS; test the API endpoint to ensure requests arent honored over unencrypted HTTP.* Use the simplest API authentication mechanism that (a) works and (b) you understand.</p>
