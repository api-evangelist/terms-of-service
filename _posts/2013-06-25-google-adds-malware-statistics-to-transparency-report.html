<p>In an effort to draw awareness to just how unsafe the Internet has become, Google will be adding statistics about malware to its transparency report.Google’s transparency report currently documents criminal requests and national security requests from government’s worldwide, though it does not include requests from the federal government’s Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court regarding Google’s foreign users.Since that court made headlines this month, Google and other tech companies have been trying to contain the public relations crisis that has resulted from revelations that they have been aiding government surveillance efforts when ordered to by the court.Google has since filed a legal motion asking the government to relax its gag order and allow the company to disclose the number of FISA requests it receives.At the same time, Google said on Monday it would also be expanding its transparency report to include new numbers around malware and phishing attacks on the Internet.</p>
