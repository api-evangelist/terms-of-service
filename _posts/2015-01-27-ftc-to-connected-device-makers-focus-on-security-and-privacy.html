<p>The Federal Trade Commission just laid out its initial recommendations for the burgeoning Internet of Things industry -- and theyre pretty much what youd expect.In an extensive report (PDF) released this morning, the agency emphasized that connected device makers will need to think hard about security, as well as how they manage consumers private information.That shouldnt be news to any company thats been developing web-enabled products over the past few decades, but itll be particularly important when even the most mundane devices in our lives are filled with sensors and connected.The only way for the Internet of Things to reach its full potential for innovation is with the trust of American consumers, FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement.We believe that by adopting the best practices weve laid out, businesses will be better able to provide consumers the protections they want and allow the benefits of the Internet of Things to be fully realized.</p>
