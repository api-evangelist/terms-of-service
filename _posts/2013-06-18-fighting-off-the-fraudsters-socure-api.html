<p>The World Wide Web can be a charlatan’s playground with the potential of accessing reams of personal details and passwords to exploit as they please.Of course, there are secure solutions in place and we can all do our bit to ensure our information remains safe, but in some cases, fraud manages to succeed.Socure is an identity fraud detection service aimed at providing organisations or website owners with the tools to help prevent fraud and ensure that their customers are who they say they are.Socure’s API makes it possible to integrate this functionality into websites and applications.Socure’s Social Biometrics Solution is an artificial intelligence system and proprietary machine that uses social behaviour pattern analysis to learn algorithms and ultimately determine whether the identification used on a site registration is authentic or not.</p>
