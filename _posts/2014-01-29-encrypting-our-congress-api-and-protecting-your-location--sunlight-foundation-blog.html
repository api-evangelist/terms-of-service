<p>Sunlights Congress API receives millions of requests every month for data about all things Congress.Many of these requests include information about a users location, generally to look up which members of Congress represent a given zip code or latitude/longitude pair.Since June 2013, Sunlights Congress API has supported the use of encryption via HTTPS (https://
).More recently, we began recommending HTTPS as the default protocol to use with our Congress API, though plain HTTP will continue to be supported.If youre using our Congress API — especially if you use our endpoints that look up congressional representation based upon zip code or latitude/longitude — we strongly recommend you use HTTPS.</p>
