<p>A security flaw in an early version of Googles new Internet-connected glasses could allow hackers to control the device remotely and use its camera to watch your every move, according to one developer.In a blog post this week, software developer Jay Freeman said he found a way for hackers to install malicious software on Google Glass to conduct surveillance on its users.Freeman was one of the early Glass adopters selected by Google to test the device before its release to the general public next year.Glass, a head-mounted computer that rests on the users face like a pair of eyeglasses, can take photos, translate phrases and offer directions via a small glass cube suspended over the wearers right eye.Freeman said hackers can compromise the headset by using a known vulnerability in Googles Android software, granting them even greater access to users privacy than if they had bypassed security on a phone or computer.</p>
