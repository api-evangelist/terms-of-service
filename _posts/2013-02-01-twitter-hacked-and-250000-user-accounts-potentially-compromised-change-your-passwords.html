<p>In a blog post today, Twitter has let users know that around 250,000 accounts have potentially been compromised.That means its time to change your passwords.Twitter found unusual access patterns on some accounts.Subsequently, theyve revoked access to all compromised accounts, and you should receive an email requiring you to reset your password if yours was hacked.That said, if youre worried about your account, nows as good a time as any to change your password for Twitter (and any other account with the same email and password combination).</p>
