<p>The WordPress ecosystem appears to facing its worst ever coordinated brute force attack.Content delivery network CloudFlare says it blocked 60 million requests against its WordPress customers in a single hour.The Next Web reported earlier on Friday that hosting providers around the world are seeing a substantial increase in brute force attacks against WordPress and Joomla sites, with some hosts seeing as much as triple the volume of attacks as usual.The requests, which are targeted at administrative accounts, appear to be coming from a sophisticated botnet that may be comprised of as many as 100,000 computers, based on the number of unique IP addresses the attacks are coming from.CloudFlare also began seeing a similar attack earlier this week and corroborated the attackerâ€™s specific methodology with other hosts.</p>
