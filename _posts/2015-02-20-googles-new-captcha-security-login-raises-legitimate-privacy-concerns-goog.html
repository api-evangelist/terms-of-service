<p>The “CAPTCHA” has infuriated web users for years: Its that login test that asks you to type in a hard-to-read sequence of letters or numbers in order to prove are not a robot.Get one letter wrong and youll be denied access.In a bid to ease that irritation, Google launched what it dubbed the “No Captcha ReCAPTCHA in December, which it claims has the ability to verify a human user by looking at things like the behavior of their mouse movements and the way they type.But device recognition company AdTruth believes it has found evidence Google’s CAPTCHA killer is collecting far more information than mouse coordinates alone, and that it could use the security tool to inform its advertising services too.The new tool isnt overtly labeled as a Google service, yet anyone clicking through it consents to be tracked by Googles cookies, AdTruth found.</p>
