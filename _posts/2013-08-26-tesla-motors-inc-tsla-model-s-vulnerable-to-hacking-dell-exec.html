<p>Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s Model S sedan has been praised as one of the best (by Consumer Reports) and safest vehicles on the road, but one executive at Dell Inc (NASDAQ:DELL) believes hackers could pose a threat to the vehicle.George Reese posted an article on the topic at the O’Reilly Community.Tesla’s Model S uses an API
 According to Reese, the threat lies in the application programming interface (or API) used by Tesla.The Tesla REST API is quite handy, enabling drivers to check the battery charge of their Model S, adjust the climate control and panoramic roof, honk the horn and more.“Identify where the hell you [sic] car is and what it’s doing” is also on his list, in those words exactly.</p>
