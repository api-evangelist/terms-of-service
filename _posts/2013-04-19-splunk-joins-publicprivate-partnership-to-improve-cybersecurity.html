<p>Last week Splunk joined several other companies at U.S.NIST’s signing ceremony symbolizing our participation and partnership in the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE).There’s no doubt that there is a critical need to protect private-sector intellectual property and other valuable business data from a growing number of cyber threats.This partnership illustrates our commitment to the spirit of collaboration while providing real-world cybersecurity capabilities that address business needs.</p>
