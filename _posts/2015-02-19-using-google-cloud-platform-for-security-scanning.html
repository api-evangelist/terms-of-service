<p>Deploying a new build is a thrill, but every release should be scanned for security vulnerabilities.And while web application security scanners have existed for years, they’re not always well-suited for Google App Engine developers.They’re often difficult to set up, prone to over-reporting issues (false positives)—which can be time-consuming to filter and triage—and built for security professionals, not developers.Today, we’re releasing Google Cloud Security Scanner in beta.If you’re using App Engine, you can easily scan your application for two very common vulnerabilities: cross-site scripting (XSS) and mixed content.</p>
