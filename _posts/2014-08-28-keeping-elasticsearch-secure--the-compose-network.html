<p>People have asked us “You run Elasticsearch databases, how do you secure them?”.It’s a good question to ask because Elasticsearch doesn’t have any authentication mechanisms built in, or users or roles or anything that resembles them.Elasticsearch has been built to not be exposed to the shared corporate network, let alone the internet.It has been built to run on a private network importing data and delivering search results to systems connected to that private network.</p>
