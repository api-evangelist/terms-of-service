<p>Internet security is a subject that is being covered more and more frequently by technology blogs and with good reason: the number of high profile internet security breaches has gone up substantially in the last few years.According to Semantec, 2013 saw a 62-percent increase in the number of breaches, a 91-percent increase in targeted attack campaigns, over 552M identities exposed via breaches, with 1 in 8 legitimate websites having a critical vulnerability.With these kinds of internet security threat statistics, internet security was a hot topic at many of the 2014 API conferences, including ProgrammableWebâ€™s API conference in London (See SlideShare presentation by David Berlind, editor-in-chief of ProgrammableWeb).Many of the high profile internet security breaches happened within the last year or so, some due to API security vulnerabilities.Companies that have had to deal with recent internet security breaches and/or API security vulnerabilities include Buffer, Pinterest, Facebook, and Snapchat.</p>
