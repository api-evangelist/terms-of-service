<p>This week we had 59 new APIs added to our API directory including a StumbleUpon URL utility, semantic text analysis service, SMS marketing service, financial analysis, planning, and reporting service, Intuit hosted payments service and a data analysis and management service.In addition we looked at how the Screenr API can help support your systems.Below are more details on each of these new APIs.AdaptivePlanning API: The service provides a suite of financial analytics and planning functions, including annual budgeting, forecasting, variance analysis, and consideration of what-if scenarios.It integrates with with many familiar general ledger (GL) systems, as well as customer relationship management (CRM), and human resource (HR) planning systems.</p>
