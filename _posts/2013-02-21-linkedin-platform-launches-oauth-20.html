<p>Kamyar Mohager, Feb 21, 2013              At LinkedIn, one of our three key product goals is simplicity.Unfortunately, many developers have found OAuth 1.0a to be anything but simple.While secure, it has some complexities that can make it difficult for developers to successfully create applications on the LinkedIn Platform.Weve heard from our community about their interest in OAuth 2.</p>
