<p>Availability and safety are some of the most important implicit factors to the user experience of your platformâ€™s users.When we discuss web security to ensure these factors, images of criminal rings using sophisticated techniques come to mind.Even if your data seems too low of worth for this scenario, perhaps the over-caffeinated, zit-faced script kiddie wreaking havoc on your operations is a fear.However, the all-too-common reality in the API world is that your worst enemies are often your worst customers.Irresponsible or unknowledgeable developers writing super chatty apps.</p>
