Today, a vulnerability in SSH (CVE-2014-6271) was made public.The vulnerability addresses a weakness in Bash that allows for arbitrary code execution when initializing environment variables.Attackers could exploit the vulnerability if they had SSH access to our Git servers.Once alerted, we quickly patched every Git front-end in our system and verified that the patch fixed the problem.After fixing Git, we continued patching every server in all of our data centers for good measure.</p>
