<p>For developers building REST-based APIs, there is a great deal of misinformation and some understandable confusion about when to use HTTP PUT and when to use HTTP POST.Some say, POST should be used to create a resource, and PUT to modify one.Others that PUT should be used to create, and POST to modify one.Neither is quite right.Often, developers think of each HTTP method as a 1:1 relationship with CRUD operations:
 This can be true, with GET and DELETE specifically, but when it comes to which HTTP methods should be associated with create and update, the answer comes down to idempotency.</p>
