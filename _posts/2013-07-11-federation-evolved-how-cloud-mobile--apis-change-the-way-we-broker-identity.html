<p>The adoption of cloud by organizations looking for more efficient ways to deploy their own IT assets or as a means to offset the burden of data management drives the need for identity federation in the enterprise.Compounding this is the mobile effect from which there is no turning back.Data must be available any time, from anywhere and the identities accessing it must be asserted on mobile devices, in cloud zones, always under the stewardship of the enterprise.APIs serve federation by enabling lightweight delegated authentication schemes based on OAuth handshakes using the same patterns as used by social login.The standard specifying such patterns is OpenID Connect where a relying party subjects a user to an OAuth handshake and then calls an API on the identity provider to discover information about the user thus avoiding having to setup a shared secret with that user â€“ no identity silo.</p>
