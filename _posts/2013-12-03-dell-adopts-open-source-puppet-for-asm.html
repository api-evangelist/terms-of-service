<p>Of the many great things about open source, one has to be the pleasant surprise of learning how someone picked it up on their own and applied it in a new way to solve a problem they had. We’re constantly surprised by the unbounded creativity exhibited throughout the community.It is in this spirit we’re excited to welcome Dell, which today announced   its integration of open source Puppet with Dell’s Active System Manager (ASM), a tool for managing converged infrastructure of compute, network and storage resources. Now users of ASM and Puppet will have a single, centralized platform to manage converged workloads throughout their data center.And this is just the beginning.</p>
