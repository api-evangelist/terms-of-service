<p>On Thursday, Facebook announced the global launch of its Trusted Contacts password recovery feature.With this service, users can designate between three to five friends who can be contacted if there are any problems accessing the user’s account.It’s an enhanced security measure designed to make it more difficult for hackers and those with malicious intent to take over someone’s Facebook account.Originally launched back in 2011 as Trusted Friends, the social networking company has since rebranded it as Trusted Contacts.In doing so, Facebook has also redesigned and made some updates to improve its offering.</p>
