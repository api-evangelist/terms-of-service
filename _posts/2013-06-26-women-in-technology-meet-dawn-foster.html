<p>At Puppet Labs, we are big believers in promoting a culture of openness and diversity.Those values are core to everything we do, from who we hire to how we share information and build community.That’s why we’re excited to kick off the first installment of our Women in Technology blog series featuring our own Dawn Foster.Before joining Puppet Labs as community lead, Dawn built developer and open source communities for Intel, Jive Software and others.Dawn frequently speaks at conferences on topics ranging from building community and hacking open source technologies to helping women succeed in technology.</p>
