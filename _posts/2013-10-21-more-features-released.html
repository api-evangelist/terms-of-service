<p>We’ve had tons of people ask for compliance reason to have the ability to print a fax confirmation like ‘old school’ fax machines would do.Your wish is our command.Simply go to the Information (i) screen and click ‘Print’ from there.You can do this for either ‘sent’ faxes or ones you have ‘received’.Up pops a simple fax confirmation page to print.</p>
