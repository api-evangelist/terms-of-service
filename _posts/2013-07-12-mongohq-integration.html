<p>PagerDuty is happy to announce that there is now a direct integration with MongoHQ. MongoHQ is a MongoDB-as-a-service hosting platform on AWS, Rackspace, Softlayer, and custom deployments.MongoHQ has an alerting mechanism to notify you when there are critical database changes or performance issues.Using the PagerDuty integration, these alerts can now trigger incidents within PagerDuty.The incident would then notify your team according to your PagerDuty escalation policies, on-call schedules and contact methods.</p>
