<p>Greetings card website Moonpig has left private information for up to three million customers exposed to the world for years – with a tech expert describing their security as ‘half-a***d’.The company shut down its mobile apps to deal with the problem today.Credit card information and passwords are not thought to have leaked, but other private information from customer accounts may well have been open to intruders.Developer Paul Price posted an entry on his blog yesterday claiming that a flaw in the website’s security settings meant that anyone could pose as another user, getting access to a portion of their credit card details and personal information as well as being able to make orders from their account.Mr Price said he discovered the problem in August 2013 and told Moonpig then, but despite the company saying it would ‘get right on it’, the glitch was still in place yesterday.</p>
