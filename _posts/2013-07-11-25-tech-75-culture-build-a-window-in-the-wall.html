<p>As methodologies lead and former professional services engineer at Puppet Labs, Eric Shamow has stories.Like the one where the dev and ops teams were butting heads so hard that their manager thought it might be easier to just fire one group and start fresh.“Dev and ops weren’t talking to each other, not using the same toolset, really resenting each other.There was no way to get the teams on the same page,”  he remembers.The manager’s frustration was easy to understand.</p>
