<p>At the University of Arizona, credential strength was a key concern for many years.In spite of implementing stringent (and unpopular) password standards which included password strength checks and lockout measures, the U of A continued to fight an ongoing battle with compromised login credentials.The University of Arizona’s Information Technology Services department (UITS) decided to employ two-factor authentication to address password insecurity within central IT and across campus.Since the initial roll-out, UITS’ Senior Enterprise Systems Architect, Gary Windham, has aimed to expand the program to additional users.In this webinar, he describes the challenges UITS is addressing and future plans.</p>
