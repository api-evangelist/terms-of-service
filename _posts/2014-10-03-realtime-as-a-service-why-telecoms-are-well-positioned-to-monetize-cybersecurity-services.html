<p>It’s a shame how the IT industry has co-opted the term “cloud.  
Twenty-two years ago when I first started following telecom, when you saw the words “in the cloud, it meant the telecom cloud.    
But no more.  Today, thanks to some clever marketing/ PR, when you need a cloud application, who do you naturally think should fill that need?Why an IT firm, of course … the likes of an IBM, SAP, HP, or Amazon’s IT department.</p>
