<p>Last Tuesday, Google announced that its Google Compute Engine is now generally available to the public.Listen in to this podcast to hear Eric, Aaron and Dawn discuss and explore the integrations between Google Cloud Platform and Puppet.GCP is a collection of services created using Googles experience scaling and supporting their own services: platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service options, storage solutions and a range of other services and developer tools.In Puppet Enterprise 3.1, we updated our cloud provisioner to work natively with Google Compute Engine, and theres now a node type for GCE.</p>
