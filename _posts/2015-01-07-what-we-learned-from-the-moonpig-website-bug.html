<p>When developer Paul Price published a blog this week detailing what he described as a serious vulnerability in Moonpig’s website, the popular greetings card company shut down its mobile apps while it investigates the matter.Price, however, claims to have first warned the company about the flaw way back in 2013 and only went public due to what he says is Moonpig’s inaction to fix the problem.The vulnerability is said to lie in the website’s application programming interface (API), a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.The flaw gave hackers access to customer ID numbers by sending in an API request, which required no authentication.API calls were not rate-limited, so attackers could work their way through different combinations until they discovered each customer ID.</p>
