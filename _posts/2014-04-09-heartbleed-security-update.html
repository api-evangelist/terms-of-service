<p>Less than 36 hours ago, we learned about a potential security exploit called “Heartbleed” on some websites that use Linux/Apache and OpenSSL to secure customer information.OpenSSL enables SSL and TLS encryption, which governs HTTPS – the secure communications between your computer and the servers on the Internet.It is used by about 2/3 of the web servers in the world.This vulnerability was the result of a programming error (or bug) in several versions of OpenSSL.Put simply, we do not use this OpenSSL encryption technology for our applications and consequently were not affected in any way.</p>
