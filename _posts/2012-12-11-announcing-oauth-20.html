<p>We know many of our developers have been waiting a while on this but we have just recently released OAuth 2 for our API.Â As part of this release any new applications must use OAuth.For existing applications the API client key credentials will continue to work until until Feb.15th 2013 but we encourage any developers to migrate their apps to OAuth as soon as possible.Documentation is available along with some long over due edits on the API Docs site ( http://apidocs.</p>
