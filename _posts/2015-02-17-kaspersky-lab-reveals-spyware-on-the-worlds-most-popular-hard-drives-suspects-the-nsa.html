<p>The security researchers at Kaspersky Lab have revealed that an agency – most likely the NSA – has developed spyware that can be hidden on hard drives.The software has been found to work with hardware made by Western Digital, Seagate, Toshiba, IBM, Micron Technology and Samsung, and could provide a means to conduct surveillance “on the majority of the world’s computers.”
Kaspersky reports that it has found a series of different backdoors, according to Reuters.It has detected variants of the software on machines in over 30 countries, including Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and China.Targets included government and military institutions, telecom companies, banks, energy firms, nuclear researchers, journalists and Islamic activists.</p>
