<p>It’s taken a bit of time to polish it up, but the Puppet Developer certification exam is now live at a Pearson VUE Testing Center near you!It’s no small feat to create a high-stakes, professional certification exam that individuals can use to prove their skill-set against a defined benchmark.It’s even more challenging when creating a developer level exam that must be written by Puppet developers and then beta tested within the community.This level of effort takes time and many volunteers to complete.After taking the time to write the Puppet Developer exam last summer, we initially launched the beta version of the exam at PuppetConf 2012.</p>
