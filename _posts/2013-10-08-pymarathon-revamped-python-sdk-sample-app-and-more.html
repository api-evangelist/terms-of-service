<p>We’ve talked up our support for Ruby and our involvement in its community a lot lately, but Pythonistas need take no offense; we’re just as amped to improve our Python support, too.That’s why we’re super excited to announce that we’ve shipped a new and improved Python SDK and sample apps today.The improved Python toolkit makes it even easier to integrate Stormpath into your application, whether it’s built on Django, Flask, or anything in between.Here are some of the highlights:
The Python SDK now implements caching to reduce the number of calls the SDK makes out to the Stormpath service, reducing network latency overhead wherever possible.Simplified Resource CRUD and Search
Resource create, retrieve, update, and delete calls have all been appropriated to Python.</p>
