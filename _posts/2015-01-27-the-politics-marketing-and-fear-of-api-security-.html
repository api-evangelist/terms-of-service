<p>27 Jan 2015   
I cringe, when I think about the number of mobile applications out there, that people depend on in their personal and professional lives, that are using insecure APIs, allowing personally identifiable information (PII) to flow across the open Internet.I’m a big advocate for helping mobile developers understand the important role that a public API can play in this situation, but another side of the discussions that also scares me is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) that also emerges as part of this conversation.I’ve covered recent security and privacy involving mobile usage of APIs at Snapchat, and Moonpig, and was processing the API news this morning for inclusion on API.Report, when I came across this press release, Wandera Finds Official NFL App to be Leaking Users Personal Data Just Days Ahead of The Big Game.I can get behind the NFL securing their users personal data, but have a hard time jumping on the bandwagon when this is used as PR for a mobile security service, in the lead up to the Superbowl.</p>
