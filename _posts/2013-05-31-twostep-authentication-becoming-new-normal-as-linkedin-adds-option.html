<p>Two-step authentication is becoming the new standard in social media security.LinkedIn is the latest major social network to finally add the option.The opt-in feature for the professional social network follows up a similar move by Twitter last week.Two-factor identity authentication lines up both platforms better with the likes of Facebook and Google as well as plenty of other enterprise-focused cloud platforms that already implement higher security for protecting sensitive data.The lack of such an option has definitely plagued Twitter the most -- at least from a public viewpoint.</p>
