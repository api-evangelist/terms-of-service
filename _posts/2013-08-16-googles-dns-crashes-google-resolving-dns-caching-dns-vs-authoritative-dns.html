<p>Yesterday was not good for folks who use Google’s Resolving DNS services (known as Google DNS).Indeed, many users – not surprisingly – were flipping out when they were unable to visit any website or correspond via email.  Many users took to their mobile devices, which were hopefully not using Google DNS, to look for fixes.A number of outlets, such as Gawker, Gizmodo, and Geekosystem covered the story and explained what was going on.Lifehacker offered help on solving the issue.</p>
